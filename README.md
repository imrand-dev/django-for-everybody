This specialization introduces Python programmers to building websites using the Django library. Across the four courses, you will learn HTML, CSS, SQL, Django, JavaScript, jQuery, and JSON Web Services. During the specialization, you will build online websites using Django and those working websites are graded throughout the specialization. This series is excellent preparation for learning other ways to build web applications using technologies like PHP, Flask or Ruby on Rails. This is a great first course in any web development curriculum.

In this Specialization, students will learn how to build Django applications and by the end of the course, they will have built a simple website to store and view classified ads with features like photos, search, and favorites.
